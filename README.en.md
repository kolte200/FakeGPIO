First, you're gonna need python. Download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During python's installations you will have a checkbox for if you want to asked Python to PATH. Do it. Then you will be asked if you want to disable PATH length limit. Do it.<br>
Congratulations! You now have Python!
