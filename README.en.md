## Vocabulary
Git: Program behind github.com's website<br>
Repository (plural: repositories, sgortcut: repo): Project, place where we upload our files, our code.<br>
Fork: Someone else's repository local copy. Linked to the original.<br>
Commit: Modifications for a repository.<br>
Pull request: Request to commit on someone else's repo. Must be approuved by the author to take place.

## Good to know
Most of github's repositories have a part of their README or a file named CONTRIBUTING to give indications on the way to contibute to THIS particular repository. My tutorial doesn't aim at replacing these texts my only goal here is to show you what tools exist and where to find them.

## Tutorial

1) Open an issue (optionnal because you actually can use already opened issues or just don't link your contribution to an issue)
